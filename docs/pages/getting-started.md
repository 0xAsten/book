# What is Dojo?

Ohayo Sensei!

Dojo is an open-source, provable game engine built with Cairo, designed to be the ultimate toolchain for creating onchain games.

Dojo enables developers to go from concept to a fully realized onchain game in days.

TLDR Dojo is;

- Cairo framework for building onchain games
- Rust based indexing for your games
- Rust based CLI tooling for improved development flow
- Apache 2.0 Open source - always has been, always will be
- Built by a vibrant community of engineers and gamers
