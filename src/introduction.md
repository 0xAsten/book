# Introduction

Dojo is an engine for building Autonomous Worlds. It is designed to simplify the process of creating, managing, and scaling these ever expanding onchain universes.

Dojo leverages an [entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) and [diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) pattern to provide a modular, extensible world. Worlds are expanded through the introduction of Components (state) and Systems (logic).
