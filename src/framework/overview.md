# Overview

Dojo employs an Entity Component System (ECS) to represent worlds. The ECS offers a straightforward and modular architecture for understanding a world's state and its state transition functions. By separating concerns into distinct entities, components, and systems, the ECS approach enables developers to easily manage complex interactions, create reusable code, and promote maintainability.
