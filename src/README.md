# Introduction

Dojo is a verifiable game engine and toolchain for building onchain games and autonomous worlds with Cairo 1.0.

Dojo leverages an [entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) and [diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) pattern to provide a modular, extensible world. Worlds are expanded through the introduction of Components (state) and Systems (logic).

#### Key Features
- Cairo 1.0 Entity Component System (ECS)
- Sozu world migration planner
- Torii networking & indexing stack
- Katana RPC development network
- Typed SDKs
