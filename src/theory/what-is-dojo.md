# What is Dojo?

Dojo is the culmination of lessons learned from attempts at building [onchain games](https://naavik.co/digest/primer-fully-on-chain-gaming), an emerging sector in the gaming industry. Any developer who has endeavored to build an onchain game appreciates the inherent engineering hurdles - a realization that drove us to create Dojo. Just as you wouldn't recreate Unity every time you develop a new game, the same principle applies here. Dojo is designed to handle the complex infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on the unique aspects of their games.

### Stop building infrastructure, start building games

Dojo suite of tools takes the infrastructure complexity out of building onchain games. It contains:

1. **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Crafted in [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo), it provides a solid foundation to structure your game.
2. **[Torii Indexer](/crates/torii/README.md)**: Say goodbye to manually creating indexers. Torii does it automatically for you!
3. **[Katana Network](/crates/katana/README.md)**: An RPC development network to streamline and expedite your game's iterative processes.
4. **[Sozo CLI](/crates/sozo/README.md)**: Your trusty CLI tool to oversee and upkeep your worlds.
5. **Typed SDKs**: For clients

### Aspirations of Dojo

Dojo aspires to be the go-to tool for building provable games. Dojo is radically open-source, and all contributions are welcome.
